nnn plugins. When using them, please make them executable.

chmodplus is my own plugin. It adds/removes executable file permission.

Other plugins I am using:

- [cbcp](https://github.com/jarun/nnn/blob/master/plugins/.cbcp) (copy selection to system clipboard)  
- cd on quit  
- [preview-tui](https://github.com/jarun/nnn/blob/master/plugins/preview-tui) (provide [live previews](https://github.com/jarun/nnn/wiki/Live-previews) inside the terminal)  
- [ntfy](https://github.com/jarun/nnn/blob/master/plugins/.ntfy) (notify cp/mv/rm operation)
