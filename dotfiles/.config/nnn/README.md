nnn plugins. When using them, please make them executable.

chmodplus is my own plugin. It adds/removes executable file permission.

Other plugins/features I am using:

cbcp (copy selection to system clipboard)
cd on quit
mocq (play music in moc)
ntfy (notify cp/mv/rm operation)
trash (not within this folder. Instead, this feature is listed within .profile)
