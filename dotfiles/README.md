Various config files for my desktop.

I am using them for Slackware 15.0.

These dotfiles contain settings for the following programs:
- conky
- dunst (lightweight notification daemon)
- dwm (window manager)
- dwmblocks (status bar)
- kitty (terminal emulator)
- nnn (terminal file manager)
- rofi (application launcher)
