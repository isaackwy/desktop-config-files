rofi-pass-tiny is a 'tiny' script that emulates the most basic functions of rofi-pass.
Unlike [passmenu](https://git.zx2c4.com/password-store/tree/contrib/dmenu/passmenu), it provides username as well as password autotyping.

This script is adapted from Matt Snider's [passmenu-autotype](https://github.com/matt-snider/passmenu-autotype).
My script launches a rofi instance, rather than a dmenu one.

The statusbar subfolder contains scripts for dwmblocks.
