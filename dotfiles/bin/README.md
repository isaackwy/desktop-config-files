rofi-pass-tiny is a 'tiny' script that emulates the most basic functions of rofi-pass.  
In particular, unlike [passmenu](https://git.zx2c4.com/password-store/tree/contrib/dmenu/passmenu), it provides username as well as password autotyping.

I have adapted Matt Snider's [passmenu-autotype](https://github.com/matt-snider/passmenu-autotype).
However, my script launches rofi rather than dmenu.
