Patch for slock.

This combines the following patches:  
- [background_image](https://tools.suckless.org/slock/patches/background-image/)
- [dwmlogo](https://tools.suckless.org/slock/patches/dwmlogo/)
- [showtime](https://tools.suckless.org/slock/patches/showtime/)

Also, input text color is teal (hex #199ca8), taken from Linux Mint's Mint-Y-Teal gtk theme.  
Fail text color (ex. wrong password) is red (hex #e82126), taken from Linux Mint's Mint-Y-Dark-Red gtk theme.

This patch is not for suckless's vanilla slock tarball, but instead is for Debian's suckless-tools package.
