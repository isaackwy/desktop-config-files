## Patches:
- [linesbelowprompt-and-fullwidth](http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/lines-below-prompt/): Taken from upstream dwm patches page and adapted for dmenu 5.2.
- mint-y-dark-teal: My own patch, which changes the color scheme to Linux Mint's Mint-Y-Dark-Teal gtk [theme](https://github.com/linuxmint/mint-themes).
- reduce-horiz-indent: My own patch, which shifts dmenu's indentation slightly to the left. I have applied this patch only for dwm's [quitprompt](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/quitprompt/). One warning though - this patch does not actually expand the output length of dmenu_run.

These patches are not for suckless's vanilla dmenu tarball, but rather for Debian's suckless-tools package.
