This folder contains my modified [nsxiv-rifle](https://codeberg.org/nsxiv/nsxiv-extra/src/branch/master/scripts/nsxiv-rifle) script (namely, nsiv-rifle-embed).  
nsxiv-rifle-embed embeds nsxiv-rifle in the running terminal window. This functionality is comparable to dwm's [swallow](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/swallow/) patch.  
However, my nsxiv-rifle-embed script has a limitation - when the terminal window changes size, the embedded nsxiv window does not change size as well (i.e. the embedded nsxiv will not fit the changed terminal window).
