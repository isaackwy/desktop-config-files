This folder contains application shortucts.

1. rofi-pass-tiny.desktop is required for launching the [rofi-pass-tiny](https://github.com/isaackwy/desktop-config-files/blob/master/Slackware15/dotfiles/bin/rofi-pass-tiny) script.
2. I have also created a shortcut for accessing zathura with tabs. Of course, this requires [zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/) and [tabbed](https://tools.suckless.org/tabbed/).
3. Syncthing desktop [entries](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/tree/main/etc/linux-desktop) are provided by the upstream maintainers.
