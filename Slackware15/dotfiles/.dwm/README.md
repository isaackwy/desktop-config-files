Autostart script for dwm.

The script should be located in `$HOME/.dwm`.

This requires the [autostart](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/autostart/) patch.

In addition, autostarting pcmanfm-qt (or any other file manager) for handling the desktop requires bakkeby's [desktop_icons](https://github.com/bakkeby/patches/blob/master/dwm/dwm-desktop_icons-6.3.diff) patch as well.
