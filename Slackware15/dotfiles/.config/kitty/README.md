breeze.conf provides a KDE5 Breeze theme for the Kitty terminal.

In addition, kitty.conf contains additional configuration options and functions for Kitty. In particular:
- `alt-y`: copy urls. This keybinding is inspired by Luke Smith's [build](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/st) of st.
- `alt-l`: select filename under current directory to copy. Requires [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/).
