This rofi theme is based on the [Matcha gtk theme](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Matcha-gtk-theme) (dark sea variant), written by Vince Liuice (vinceliuice).

My theme is adapted from leofa's [Arc-Dark](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi/blob/next/themes/Arc-Dark.rasi) rofi theme, itself available as part of rofi's defaults.

rofi >= 1.7.1 required.
