Conky theme is based on MX-Lua (from MX-Linux):  
https://github.com/MX-Linux/mx-conky-data/tree/master/MX-Lua

The following transparency setting on conky.conf is specifically for dwm (and other similar tiling window manangers):  
`own_window_type = 'override'`

When using these config files for conky, please make clock_rings.lua executable.
